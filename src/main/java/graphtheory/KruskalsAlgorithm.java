 * Kruskal's algorithm suggests that we select the edge with the minimum weight until we connect all vertices on  
 * the given graph G, where G is a graph with weighted edges. On choosing the minimum weight edge, we make sure not 
 * to form any cycles. If a cycle is formed on choosing the edge, then we choose the next minimum weighted edge
 * that has not been considered yet.
 * 
 * For NON-CONNECTED Graphs G, Prim's algorithm cannot find the minimum spanning tree.
